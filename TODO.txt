x Stop posts on the user dashboard from showing multiple times, have the backend register each post with a unique ID and propogate that throughout to debug the "react-dom_client.js?v=a88b823c:5749 Encountered two children with the same key, `1nyjf73`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted — the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version." error
x Stop posts on the user dashboard from constantly updating, after 10 posts are loaded, halt the continuous loading of posts when users are translating
x Fix saved posts to actually work and not show hardcoded defaults, allow the save to properly save something
x Fix the share button so it actually works and shows a pop-up that allows users to share posts
x Remove anymore hardcoded translation defaults and remove the hardcoded post sources that are fallbacks to reddit. Instead if reddit doesn't work don't show anything at all.
x Universalise translation to be a JSON file where we can specify mappings for Language 1 --> Language 2 and vice versa
x Fix the broken partial translation feature, I want to pre-process and cache the mixed language versions in Firestore during the scheduled job
x Fix the broken see more feature, just show all 25 posts immediately called from firestore and have a message below saying "no more posts, all 25 from cache" instead of having a see more that shows 10 at first and loads 5 upon clicking.

@ Gabriel


(A) Fix the broken posts, posts should automatically refresh and call the backend firestore cache when users swap language from korean to japanese 
(A) Remove redundant and repeated files that aren't being used by any other files
(A) Deploy backend and ensure everything works
(A) Generate new architecture diagram that explains how current system works
(A) Why do posts from reddit sometimes say invalid date
(A) Examine codebase and ensure that all posts (that are called and saved to firestore are from reddit, no other sites allowed)

@ Astin 

(C) Fix the broken onboarding process.
(C) Enhance onboarding flow with interactive examples +Features @Frontend
(C) See how passwords are stored in the DB
(C) Test via stress-test the translation and hopping from learning japanese to learning korean mode, check console log for anymore bugs
(C) Twitter into the backend (API)
