x Stop posts on the user dashboard from showing multiple times, have the backend register each post with a unique ID and propogate that throughout to debug the "react-dom_client.js?v=a88b823c:5749 Encountered two children with the same key, `1nyjf73`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted — the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version." error
x Stop posts on the user dashboard from constantly updating, after 10 posts are loaded, halt the continuous loading of posts when users are translating
x Fix saved posts to actually work and not show hardcoded defaults, allow the save to properly save something
x Fix the share button so it actually works and shows a pop-up that allows users to share posts
x Remove anymore hardcoded translation defaults and remove the hardcoded post sources that are fallbacks to reddit. Instead if reddit doesn't work don't show anything at all.
x Universalise translation to be a JSON file where we can specify mappings for Language 1 --> Language 2 and vice versa
x Fix the broken partial translation feature, I want to pre-process and cache the mixed language versions in Firestore during the scheduled job
x Fix the broken see more feature, just show all 25 posts immediately called from firestore and have a message below saying "no more posts, all 25 from cache" instead of having a see more that shows 10 at first and loads 5 upon clicking.
x Fix the broken posts, posts should automatically refresh and call the backend firestore cache when users swap language from korean to japanese 
x Remove redundant and repeated files that aren't being used by any other files
x Examine codebase and ensure that all posts (that are called and saved to firestore are from reddit, no other sites allowed)
x Deploy backend and ensure everything works
x Generate new architecture diagram that explains how current system works
