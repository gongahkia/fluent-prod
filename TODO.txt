(A) Stop posts on the user dashboard from showing multiple times, have the backend register each post with a unique ID and propogate that throughout to debug the "react-dom_client.js?v=a88b823c:5749 Encountered two children with the same key, `1nyjf73`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted — the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version." error
(A) Stop posts on the user dashboard from constantly updating, after 10 posts are loaded, halt the continuous loading of posts when users are translating
