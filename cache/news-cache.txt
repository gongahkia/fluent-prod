I used to do a monthly series on /r/Baseball where I present a baseball show to the community. Since those are basically WT! Posts, I wanted to also cross-post them here so they go into the archive. This is a one-off return (for now). See the comments for previous installments in the series.\n\nCatch Me At The Ballpark is an unconventional series. Ostensibly a sports show about baseball, the focus is not solely on the players but about all sorts of people you might meet while visiting a ballpark. Every episode is split into three segments with individual stories of food vendors, security guards, mascots, or simply visitors. Though the baseball team also becomes a focus, particularly later in the anime, our main character is Ruriko, a roaming beer vendor girl in her first season with the team.\n\nThe tone of the show is mostly comedic and light-hearted. Ruriko often interacts with an overworked young office worker named Murata and their segments have \"teasing rom com\" elements similar to series like Teasing Master Takagi-san or Don't Toy With Me Nagatoro. The show also has other romonatic themes involving the wives and girlfriends of ballplayers but especially the scenes involving american slugger Dennis Young who has developed a crush on Ruriko are very funny. \"How can you not be romantic about baseball\" in a bit of a different light, though the romanticism of athletic competition and the solidarity between fans and the team is also writ large with the subject of a \"3rd place\" away from home and work brought up.\n\nUnlike most shows in the subgenre of baseball anime, this series is about professional baseball. Of course a necessity for the subject matter, but also welcome contrast to most others that focus on high school athletic competition. In a way this show in particular builds a nice pair with Gurazeni, which is another show about professional baseball with a different focus than just the winners and losers of the games. Whereas Gurazeni's main team is a parody of the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in the Central League of NPB, the hapless Chiba MotorSuns of Catch Me At The Ballpark are a parody of the Chiba Lotte Marines of the Pacific League, with other teams from around NPB also showing up as opponents with non-copyright infringing names often referencing rock bands. The real life ZOZO Marine Stadium, rendered here as \"MotorSuns Stadium\" is the primary backdrop though there are plans to move to a new ballpark by 2030.\n\nAnother slightly less fortunate parallel with Gurazeni is the production quality due to both being low budget shows, as particularly on-field action scenes are often rough in their animation, and the usage of 3D assets that are not well composited into the scene is also quite noticeable. The writing is also not that strong, partially owed to the fact that things are meant to stay not all that serious, with it largely family friendly and light fare.\n\nDespite these flaws the show is very enjoyable fodder particularly due to the voice acting of Fairouz Ai who is well suited to Ruriko's mannerisms with an incredibly large supporting cast to play off of.
