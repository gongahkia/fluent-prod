I moved to Japan this August on the JET programme. The job is fine and my living situation is pretty convenient, but I can feel the \"ceiling\" to my situation already and I am looking for something more challenging where I can leverage my skills. To summarise my background (25M): From the UK - English is my native language but I also have bilingual proficiency in Hindi. Have JLPT N2 (also just took N1 last month, hopefully went well), worked as a Japanese-English translator for a very big Japanese company for a few months before I came to Japan. Have done interpretation work for an opening ceremony in my local area here, and day-to-day there are really no language issues with colleagues or outside of work. Still working on understanding work culture here of course! My friends have been helping me with my keigo and I'm actively trying to improve it every day. Have a STEM background (MEng degree), briefly did an internship as a research assistant. Not sure if I could leverage this for a full research role again but maybe for something that requires technical/scientific knowledge like chemical sales? I did chemical engineering for context. Worked in IT consultancy (DevOps) for a few years doing mostly non-functional testing/E2E performance testing but then also some SDET stuff, which unfortunately I was not upskilled on very well and struggled with at the time (so it wouldn't be impossible for me to learn this work with the right support). I understand there's a lot of demand in places like Tokyo - they seem to hire a lot of non-Japanese speaker people so wondering how I could provide value in this other than drawing on previous knowledge? It's been a while so I'd be happy to start from scratch again. As for what kind of jobs I'd like, I'm happy with really any office job with a bilingual environment, and I am more than happy to learn on the job. Anything that allows me to use my technical skills (whether that is my Chem Eng bg or IT experience) and soft skills (team-player, communication skills) to facilitate some kind of cross-cultural interaction between myself and clients would be ideal. I've heard translation is an industry that is rapidly going downwards so that aside, I'd be interested in doing DevOps work or some kind of chemical sales/marketing work over here if possible. I am also absolutely willing to relocate to a larger city - I understand the financial struggles that may come with this but if the city is where jobs are, I'm fine to work my way up. Since I first posted this, I have signed up to several recruitment agencies in Japan (mainly the ones affiliated with recruit . jp, and had a first 面談 (discussion) with a recruiter via a Zoom call last week. I was able to talk about my background and the kind of jobs I'm looking for, he informed me that 1. I signed up at a weird period right before Xmas so not much will happen until work resumes properly for everyone next week and that 2. since I have quite a varied background, there's quite a lot I could do. So far I've focused on refining my recruit . jp resume based on the advice he gave me, and applying to anything that looks good (like I previously said, I'm very open in terms of what I would be willing to do). Are there any good recruitment agencies that you would recommend? Or, would you recommend directly applying to places, like Rakuten for example? Thank you all so much!","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"21e3853759130a95b1e3e0e6d20456e64b050f1138e6e607075f0a6ce35638a4"}

We live in Tokyo, so we’re heading there by train (around 2 hours, if I remember right).\n\nI’ve been to Hakone before with friends but only for 1–2 days, so I don’t think I explored it fully. Last time I went we did すすき草原, the ropeway, ate the black boiled eggs at Owakudani, and visited Hakone Shrine, and that was pretty much it. When I went before, the pampas grass field was already burned, so I was also wondering if すすき草原 is open and looking good this time of year.\n\nI remember the buses being expensive and sometimes even more crowded than Tokyo, so I wanted to ask for advice. Any recommendations for a 2-day itinerary, couple-friendly spots, tips for getting around more smoothly, or whether the Hakone Free Pass is worth it?\n\nThanks!","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"b4abd8090d83a4e3860a7821afd1f613bd16bf327e9cae39f9156a55dbc47bf2"}

She says she doesn’t actually enjoy it either but eats it because it’s healthful, and so for all these years she’s been dutifully putting it away while I’ve been queasily grimacing across the table.\n\nBut somewhere along the line, something unexpected crept in: FOMO. You see those little three-packs everywhere. My favourite Japanese podcaster raves about the スーパーフード. Visiting friends ask about it.  And yet, almost night after night, I disdained what was right in front of me.\n\nThen last night, at dinner, there happened to be some Tabasco on the table. And suddenly a thought popped into my head... half curiosity, half recklessness: What if I just drown it in Tabasco and see if it hides the yuck? Possessed by this brief spell of madness, I started mixing the sauce into the slime while my wife watched with open curiosity, saying nothing.\n\nJust as I was about to bring the chopsticks to my mouth, she suggested I mix it into some rice. That seemed reasonable enough, so I did exactly that. \n\nI hate to sound like a million clickbait titles, but you won't believe what happened next.\n\nI actually liked it.\n\nNot in a polite, well-this-isn’t-terrible way; but genuinely, texture and all. The heat cut through the funk, the rice reined the sliminess into okra territory and grounded everything, and somehow the whole thing clicked. Years of dramatic refusal undone in a single, impulsive bite.\n\nNeba say neba again, I guess.\n\n(Anyone else who's discovered Tabasco salvation for natto? Or is it a common trick that finally found its way under my rock?)","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"ccf7b9f132cab7a04a5ed06b4cc1e3d873d5fbe322479b7a5eabca6f98709064"}

This time, I even have a youtube video if people prefer a (loooong) video form.\n\nIf you prefer to read the same post but on my site, you can find it here. The content is mostly the same.\n\nAnyways, here goes!\n\n--- \n\nSummary (tl;dr)\n\nIn 2025, I spent 1265 hours and 6 minutes doing the following:\n\nMedia | Time\n-|------------------------\nVideogames | 693 hours and 8 minutes\nVisual Novels | 219 hours and 32 minutes\nLight Novels | 224 hours and 33 minutes\nManga | 76 hours and 54 minutes\nAnime | 34 hours and 58 minutes\nAnki | 15 hours and 59 minutes\n\nSeeing the trend from the last two years (2024 and 2023), where I averaged pretty consistently at ~1700 hours, this year was significantly lower.\n\nHowever, at the end of last year I had told myself I would limit my content consumption to about 1200 hours, so I could invest some of the extra time on new hobbies and activities. While I ended up going above that limit by about 50 hours (if we do not consider anki), I'd like to believe I managed to stick to a pretty consistent pace as can be seen by this moyase burndown chart.\n\nYou can see a more accurate graph breakdown by month and activity by looking at\nthis picture and a total cumulative view from\nthis picture.\n\nAs always, I also track all my content consumption activities on my lingotrack account.\n\nA few highlights and comments I want to make about this year as a whole:\nI tried to reduce my Japanese consumption to prioritize other hobbies. I will admit this didn't work as well as I hoped. I just love spending all my free time on Japanese media and it's hard to cut back. This said, I did start some cool new projects like the yokubi grammar guide and a new youtube channel.\nI did a manga-volume-a-day reading challenge for the month of July, which is why my manga consumption time went up during that period. I also did a light novel reading challenge (20,000 characters per day) in August and it shows.\nThe month of August and November were my most \"active\" months. August is definitely because of the reading challenge. For November I don't have a specific reason. I guess I just had some extra time on hand.\nEarly in the year I moved into my new house in what some would consider the \"countryside\", and since then I've been interacting a lot more with both my Japanese family and other local businesses/activities. Having to deal with kindergarten stuff for my kid, talking to teachers every day, interacting with the local neighborhood association, etc. I do not track my output but I can confidently say that compared to last year I've been using Japanese way more in my every day life too.\n\nI go in more details about each media type in the following sections, or you can watch my summary youtube video although it's kinda long.\n\nManga\n\nJust like in 2024, 2025 also was a relatively slow year for manga. I read most of my manga in burst in July as I did my one volume a day challenge. Throughout the year I also read a bit of shounen jump series (mostly ルリドラゴン and ケントゥリア).\n\nIn total, I have read 55 manga volumes (+ a lot of shounen jump).\n\nSome of my favorite series I have read, with no particular order:\nあさドラ！\nMUJINA INTO THE DEEP\nエリオと電気人形\n魔女と傭兵\n終の退魔師 ―エンダーガイスター―\n\nVideogames\n\nAs usual, videogames are my main media choice of consumption and I really cannot get away from them. As I said last year, I was going to branch out to also some non-Japanese content, and I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed Expedition 33 and Silksong. Both amazing games. But we're talking about Japanese here so let's stay on track.\n\nIn 2025 I played a total of 14 videogames to completion, with one carry over into 2026 (Octopath Traveler 0).\n\nTitle | Playtime\n-|------------------------\nYakuza Ishin! | 34h28m\nAtelier Ryza 1 | 44h16m\nFantasian Neo Dimension | 59h16m\nGranblue Fantasy: Relink | 24h47m\nPersona 3 Reload | 75h06m\nYakuza Pirates in Hawaii | 47h58m\nLunar 1 Remake | 20h35m\nLunar 2 Remake | 23h18m\nLost Odyssey | 59h07m\nDragon Quest 3 HD Remake | 32h52m\nPokemon Violet | 36h41m\nBravely Default HD Remaster | 50h27m\nTrails in the Sky 1st Remake | 67h43m\nGhost of Tsushima | 41h38m\n\nSince 2023 I have been accurately tracking my currently played games in a spreadsheet and I only try to make myself play one game at a time. This year I am afraid I kinda slipped a bit as I started to play a few games in parallel and that made me drop and stop playing a bunch of them, to much of my shame. Some notable examples: Final Fantasy 13, Dragon Quest 11, Valkyrie Elysium. I just did not enjoy them as much to continue playing them, but I need to be more attentive to the time I dedicate to each of them rather than jump from game to game like I used to do in the past.\n\nThis said, back in August I ended up buying a \"retro\" Xbox One X so I could play some older Xbox 360 RPGs like Lost Odyssey, and I'm looking forward to playing Blue Dragon and Infinite Undiscovery next year.\n\nLikewise, I got nerd sniped into some retro stuff and toward the end of the year I bought an old Dreamcast console. I've always been interested in some of the retro JRPGs and VNs on that console and I stocked up with some of my backlog touching games like Sakura Wars, Skies of Arcadia, and a bunch of other games which I hope to tackle next year.\n\nVisual Novels\n\nContinuing the trend from last year, I feel like I have finally grown into the Visual Novel genre as I enjoyed quite a bit of them this year too. I read a\ntotal of 5 VNs to completion (I did drop a couple along the way though): \n\nTitle | Playtime\n-|------------------------\nKanade | 13h47m\n千の刃濤、桃花染の皇姫 | 47h12m\n時計仕掛けのレイライン －黄昏時の境界線－ | 27h41m\n白昼夢の青写真 | 61h34m\n岩倉アリア | 26h26m\n\nI go in more details on a few of them in my youtube video, but basically I can say I have thoroughly enjoyed most of them, aside from one specific side story in 白昼夢の青写真 which was insanely creepy to the point of almost souring the whole VN for me.\n\nAs for the rest, in 2024 I had read EVE: Burst Error and now with a new dreamcast waiting for me, I am planning to pick up some of the other VNs in the same franchise. I already bought EVE: The Lost One on PC which is a fairly controversial \"sequel\", and I also got EVE: Zero on Dreamcast which is the prequel. I'm really looking forward to reading them, but that's a story for next year.\n\nLight Novels / Books\n\nBack in 2024 I had a few novel series that I was in the middle of reading. Majorly the 星界の紋章 and ある魔女が死ぬまで series. In 2025 I finished both, and some more of others. I have read a total of 12 books, and here they are:\n星界の紋章 2 and 3\nある魔女が死ぬまで 3 and 4\nKuma Kuma Kuma Bear volume 21\nレーエンデ国物語\n火狩りの王 main series (vol 1~4) and side story (vol 5)\n転生吸血鬼さんはお昼寝がしたい 1 (yeah... we don't talk about this slop)\n\nOverall I'd say my highlights of the year were the ある魔女が死ぬまで series which I really enjoyed the end, and 星界の紋章 which was... fairly hard but ended on a note that made me want to get into the main sequel 星界の戦旗.\n\nThe レーエンデ国物語 book was also very good from the point of view of someone who likes \"proper\" western-style fantasy series (not isekai). I plan to read the next books in the series too, once I get the time.\n\nAnime\n\nI don't really have much to say about anime anymore, unfortunately. I have been watching a bunch of stuff here and there, mostly one or two episodes a week during lunch break. I don't actively look super deep into new anime releases, unless there's something major coming out. I can say from recent memory I really enjoyed the Ranma 1/2 remake though. That was a very pleasant surprise that brought me back to my childhood. I'm also really looking forward to the new Madoka movie in 2026, but that's a story for next year.\n\nPlans for 2026 and the future ahead\n\nAs I mentioned, I ended 2024 with the idea of trying to hold back my Japanese time so I could dedicate more of my free time to other hobbies.\n\nWhile I'd say the plan kinda worked, at the same time it made me realize that I would rather not do that and instead continue with more Japanese for 2026, so that's where I stand right now. I have a fairly extensive backlog of games and novels I want to go through, so I think I will try to tackle that. I need to tackle my Dreamcast and Xbox backlog, while also keep up with new releases too.\n\nThis year taught me that it's okay to also do stuff not in Japanese (like playing Expedition 33) so I might look into exploring new media and non-Japanese stuff, but I won't force myself to do that via fake guardrails (like \"no more than 1200 hours of Japanese\" or whatever). I think last year's challenge was fun and gave me some more strict discipline, but at the same time I can now move on from that.\n\nFrom a personal project perspective, I want to refine and continue working on my yokubi grammar guide, maybe even introduce more special grammar points that I rarely hear talked about in other resources (We could call it yokuyokubi / 翌々日!) but first I need to finish the main guide.\n\nI also want to work on my Youtube channel more. I've been using it as a way to build new skills both in public speaking and video editing because it sounds fun. I have no expectations to become a popular youtuber or even make stuff that people find interesting, necessarily, I just like talking in front of a camera and discuss various things that I am into, like when I write on my blog/site. Ideally I'd like to post a minimum of one video a month, but I can't make promises. I'd also like to start streaming on twitch more regularly again, ideally Japanese-related or Japanese-teaching related content, but with the way my life is structured now, streaming at home with a family and a young kid is difficult. I have also a couple of \"secret\" projects that I don't feel ready to talk about yet. Maybe I'll get to them next year, maybe not. They hang on a couple of fairly volatile variables in my life so I cannot make promises.\n\n皆さん、今年もよろしくおねがいします","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"73d529e33254c2507b1d415678b95574d4f0aa49948b44636fc35bb9d3bf09b3"}

Conversations stayed almost entirely between them.\n\nMeanwhile:\nI was basically ignored\nMy wife was ignored\nEven their own father was mostly ignored\n\nIt wasn’t openly hostile or rude. No arguments, no tension. Just a very clear in-group / out-group split where no effort was made to include the people outside the main conversational core.\n\nMy wife later described it as being 放置されてた / ほっとかれてた, which felt accurate. You’re there, but no one really acknowledges you beyond surface politeness.\n\nAt one point they asked me why I wasn’t drinking. I said health reasons and that alcohol isn’t great for your body. That answer didn’t land smoothly cue the familiar awkward pause and after that there was even less engagement.\n\nThe whole experience felt like:\nYou’re expected to show up\nPresence alone fulfills the obligation\nConversation is optional and selective\nIf you’re not part of the main family side, you just… exist quietly\n\nWhat made it worse was watching my wife get sidelined too. It wasn’t just “foreign husband awkwardness” she was also excluded from the main flow, which made the whole thing feel colder and more pointless.\n\nI understand that in Japan these gatherings are often about being there rather than interacting, and that people avoid forcing conversation. But when engagement only flows one way, it starts to feel less like “politeness” and more like quiet exclusion.\n\nNot really asking for advice more curious how common this is:\nDo people just tolerate this long-term?\nOr do you eventually start limiting how much time you spend in these situations?\n\nWould be interested to hear if others have had similar experiences with extended family dynamics like this.","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"48dd662290b24b89b0f5dfaad60880bccc486170e9e4a6250a17c2786b7a1bb7"}

With the results for 2025’s 2nd EJU just released last week, I thought it would be a good time for me to talk about the exam itself and share a bit of my experiences getting to where I am.\n\nBackground:\n\nI come from a Chinese household, but I grew up with English as my main language. As such, my command of Mandarin is only at a conversational level.\n\nThe Kanji cheat code allowed me to reach the N3 level with minimal studying. From there, I decided to achieve professional fluency and read copious amounts of articles. (Think sites like gigazine and yahoonews). At the same time, I was worried that my background will come back to bite me in the ass if I don’t do something early on, so I placed my focus towards grammar and conjugations. I used Imabi to iron out my fundamentals and Bunpro to assist with more complex points.\n\nIn 2024, I attempted the EJU for the first time and July’s N2 shortly after, before enroling in a full-time language school at the end of the year.\n\nAs of today, I have passed the JLPT N1 earlier this year and finished my 2nd university interview a few days ago. I am currently preparing for interviews taking place next year and focusing on the conversational aspects of the language.\n\nFinal Results (2025/2):\nTotal: 320/400\n記述: 50/50\n読解: 179/200\n聴読解・聴解: 141/200\n\nThoughts and comments\n\nNote: This only covers the Japanese segment of the exam. Do let me know if you guys wish to hear more about the other subjects.\n\nGeneral overview:\nExam is strictly conducted in the following order: 記述 (Essay writing) > 読解 (Reading comprehension) > 聴解 (Listening comprehension).\nGoing back to previous sections can be considered cheating.\nNo breaks in between: i.e. 読解 immediately begins right after time is up for 記述. The 例 sections for the listening parts provide a much appreciated pitstop.\n記述: Essay writing\n30 minutes to choose between 1 of 2 topics on societal issues and write a 400-500 word essay on it.\nWriting practice for Kanji will be a godsend here. You really don't want to be caught struggling to remember how to write with such a strict time limit.\nA decent score (35+) would require being able to write at a high N3-N2 level.\n読解: Reading comprehension\n45 minutes to go through 25 questions > No time to go back and check over your answers.\nContent difficulty is around N2 level, but the score ceiling is easily above N1.\n聴解・聴読解: Listening and Listening-Reading comprehension\n27 questions: 12 for 聴読解, 15 for 聴解. No breaks in between.\n70-80% academic explanations about scientific or social phenomena; remaining are conversations in academic contexts (think conversations with 先輩 or 先生).\nNot as much 敬語 used as in JLPT 聴解.\nDifficulty level is N1 but with more focus on academic language.\n    聴読解*\n1st half\nYou are expected to comprehend the diagram’s contents while paying attention to the audio to arrive at the correct answer\nGraphs and axes are most common but others such as flowcharts may appear\n    聴解* \n2nd half\nSame as the 聴解 from JLPT, except the questions are largely similar: An academic excerpt or a conversation in an institutional context is played back, followed by the 4 options being read out.\nBoth the correct AND incorrect answers have to be shaded. There will be 2 rows: 正しい and 正しくない for each question, and all 4 options must be indicated if they are correct or otherwise.\n\nQuick comparison with the JLPT:\n\nDefinitely has a ceiling higher than the N1, but I would consider the floor to a decent score to be mid-high N2. Beyond a certain level, test taking skills and logical reasoning will give higher returns than language ability.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nWhile the exam is aimed at foreign students enrolling in Japanese universities, I would argue that the exam is a good post-N1 milestone, even more so if you are taking the other subjects in Japanese. It will really improve your vocabulary and reading ability, and provide a way to evaluate your written output which is something the JLPT is severely missing.\n\nTL;DR: Dedicated effort towards the EJU over the past 2 years and offering my thoughts on the exam. Feel free to leave any questions.","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"42fda6f24482ce860b2a9b8729f7ffffb65d098b2ca2534626632991d0446a85"}

My boss also said something along the lines of \"You are probably thinking of using up all your compensated holidays (for which I have about 3 weeks' worth) in March, aren't you? That's ridiculous!\" (どうせ三月いっぱい有給消化するつもりやろ？それずるいよ！).\n\nAlso unbeknownst to my boss was that I actually recorded the interview with a pocket tape recorder. Entering late December, I told the HR Department about what my boss said to me, together with the fact that I have a recording of the interview, and also to \"let them decide whether this constitutes power harrassment or not\". Of course, I wasn't keen on making the episode a full-on power harrassment case, but something to give the HR Department to work on over the next few months, I guess.\n\nOver Christmas, I think my boss actually knew that I have the recording because he was gradually distancing himself from me, not talking with me outside of work matters and stuff. This relationship between the two of us would go on over the New Year's holidays.\n\nWhich brings me to today. Now, I don't give a flying fuck whether it's the 2nd of January or not. I woke up in the morning, thought that I would give my boss a rude New Year's greetings. I emailed my boss along the lines of (in Japanese), \"Happy New Year. I will be taking 3 weeks of compensated holidays at the end of March. Please approve once we get back to work.\"\n\nOh, and by the way, my boss and my workplace would have to approve the compensated holiday regardless of what happens in terms of employee number, as mandated by Japanese labor laws. It should be also noted that should anything be said to me once the New Year holidays are over, I can always make the whole thing a full-on power harrassment case, what's with the recorded evidence and all.\n\nAnd so, the wait begins. I know some people are going to criticize me with something along the lines of, \"this is why Japanese say foreigners can't mix into our cultures!\" and so on, but you know what? I. Don't. Fucking. Care. I've made my point, and I'm feeling pretty good about it.","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"84c4146c855c7c221badebeb40404d9b9724e69f54ffe15b8b4c6b09788107b9"}

They can be both read in kun, both in yon, or 1 is in yon and the other one is in onyomi. \n\nIs there an any geographical pattern to this?

Here's a couple tips that helped me on my trip:\n\n\\- Before ordering anything, show the staff an allergy card and learn the phrase: \"これは安全ですか？/ Kore wa anzen desu ka?\". If you point to a dish and then the allergy card, asking \"is this safe?\", 9/10 times the staff will run back to the kitchen to confirm if the ingredients overlap with your allergies! (Do be prepared to thank them, apologize and walk away if there's nothing compatible on the menu however as this has happened to me a handful of times.)\n\n\\- Most restaurants have allergy menus online or in person - check beforehand online if possible, but if you can't find one be sure to ask as soon as you get there!\n\n\\- Be careful of oils, a surprising number of dishes are cooked with sesame oil! (I spent 30 minutes walking to a local pancake place in Koenji only to be turned away since everything was fried in sesame oil so always have a backup)\n\n\\- Some places are more willing to make substitutes than the internet would make you think! This might apply more to local spots than chains, but I went to a few local spots that primarily cooked in sesame oil that went out of their way to clean the equipment and use vegetable oils just for my order specifically - I wouldn't go into anywhere expecting this, but some places will very kindly offer :)\n\n\\- You might have to just flat out avoid ramen 💀 I know this seems like a sin if you're visiting japan of all places but from my experience 99% of the ramen I came across had some kind of dashi in the broth or involved some kind of allergen I had to steer clear from. (I did actually have allergy-safe ramen a single time on my trip, but it was from mister fucking donut of all places)\n\n\\- Nuts aren't really a big worry in my experience, but ALWAYS translate food packaging before eating anything just in case as some chocolates/pastries might have nuts where you wouldn't expect - I luckily never ran into any issues here though!\n\n\\- The single slight allergy scare I had was on the 1st day in a food court when I ordered a hamburg steak - I checked their allergy menu and it was safe on paper but they fried it in the same oils as all their seafood (which they made clear beforehand) - so this was 100% my fault - I never once came across someone who wasn't happily willing to double check ingredients/cross contamination so as long as you always check you should be fine!\n\n\\- There's a decent amount of cross contamination in a lot of food places but I never had any issues with it (and I have severe allergies) - of course do keep this in mind if you know this is an issue for you! Most staff will ask if cross contamination is okay, but if they don't you might want to ask them to clarify.\n\n\\- Yoshinoya is the GOAT! Extensive allergy list, open 24/7, cheap, fast, delicious - this was my go-to spot when I couldn't find anything safe since there are tons of these around!\n\n\\- Pork/beef dishes are generally safe from allergens so look out for them if you're in a pinch, it might help when sifting through allergy menus!\n\n  \nThis is about all I can think to mention but feel free to ask any questions :)\n\nI still had tons of lovely food, it just had to be a bit more westernized than the average japan trip to keep me alive - would absolutely do it again!","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"b90401a5434b0dccb700ac91cedeab4135f0c05e4c5aa4ec4133b7b5a253a31f"}

I live in 大久保　and lately I’ve been noticing a number of people just openly littering with no shame. I don’t think these are tourists. I’m making this post, because in just two days I witnessed too much bad behavior, and it just makes me think of the anti-foreigner sentiment that’s in the air these days.\n\nA number of people openly throwing their food packaging on the street as if it were nothing. The last straw was just now, another dude ordering street food in pretty decent Japanese, and then proceeding to throw his trash out in the street. I called him 馬鹿　and he turned to me and said “what?” And then walked away. Who knows, maybe he’s a lurker here. Why would you do this?! What’s wrong with you? Sorry again, just venting. If it were an isolated incident, I wouldn’t make this post, but too many things happened over the past few days. I usually don’t go out so much, but the past two days, I was busy running errands all day, so I got to see witness all this. The vast majority of foreign residents are not doing this of course, but 4-5 instances in just in just 2 days is too much. For those of you who live in areas with a huge foreigner population, do you witness such things regularly? The people openly littering looked like they were of the same ethnicity except the one I called 馬鹿 (And no, they were not Chinese). Obviously, different cultures have different values and Japan is not perfect, but one of the reasons why I moved here was this general collective sense of shared responsibility. It’s something that I value a lot. To see people just openly spitting on this aspect of Japanese culture that I love so much is really irritating.","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"d9ec0d2029845f6e1af09f9a8f2a7720ad06428bdf27a1399f604ceee3bf74d7"}

Said bus, about which we only found out through google maps, should depart at 06:26 from this \"Aikuraguchi bus stop\".

I know this is uncommon, but the land and the house are two completely separate purchases: the real estate agent selling the land and the house maker are two different entities. Because we have already signed the land contract, we are required to pay for it within a couple of months. However, the house construction could theoretically be delayed (although we would prefer not to, for various reasons).\n\nThis brings me to the main topic of this post: figuring out the bank loan.\n\nMy wife’s company has an agreement with りそな銀行, and she has been told that she can borrow up to 6000万 yen on her own at a favorable variable interest rate (変動金利型) of 0.6%. However, because I do not yet have permanent residency, we were told that we cannot take out a pair loan (ペアローン) with りそな銀行. As far as I understand, I cannot take out a separate housing loan (住宅ローン) for the remaining 2000万 yen with another bank, because only one bank can hold a mortgage lien (抵当権) on a single property.\n\nOn the other hand, I know for certain that SBI新生銀行 does lend to foreigners without permanent residency who are married to Japanese nationals. At the moment, this seems to be the only viable option. Since our choices are limited, I really want to get it right. What I would like to get from this post is advice on how to increase the chances of being approved by SBI.\n\nIn particular:\nShould my wife apply instead of me?\nShould we apply for a pair loan, or should one of us apply with income combination (収入合算)?\nShould I pay for the land in cash, or should I apply for a bridge loan (つなぎ融資)?\nAny other advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBefore anyone suggests it, I am aware that waiting until I receive permanent residency would make things much simpler. However, that would likely take at least another year and a half, and our age and life plans cannot wait that long. I can work remotely, and my wife strongly wants (and honestly needs) to change job. Moving to Nagano and starting a family in our new home feels like the right timing for us.\n\nFinally, here are some additional details about our situation:\n\nMe\nAge: 36\nNationality: Italian\nPR status: Applied in November 2025 via the points-based system\nJob: Engineer\nYears at current company: 3.5\nCompany size: \\~180 employees, publicly listed\nAnnual income: 820万 yen\nSavings: about 700万 yen\nJapanese level: N1\n\nWife\nAge: 32\nNationality: Japanese\nJob: R&D\nYears at current company: 7.5\nCompany size: \\~5000 employees, publicly listed\nAnnual income: 750万 yen\nSavings: I am not sure, but on the order of 500万 yen\n\nLand\nPrice: 700万\nSurface: \\~3000m2\n\nHouse\nQuote: \\~7000万\nSurface: \\~150m2\n\nPS  \nI have already asked for advice on 知恵袋, and I have been to SBIマネープラザ once. I plan to go back there on January 6th. Here, I would like to hear your opinion as foreigners living in Japan.\n\nPS\n\nBecause many people are obsessing about the price of the house, let me share the reason for its seemingly high value. My wife's father is a retired architect. Her dream was to have our house designed by his father, who currently has a disability and might leave us at any moment. The design is pretty eccentric (as we like it), and in recent years, the housing prices have skyrocketed. Given all of that, the quotation from the house maker was really reasonable, according to everyone who looked at it.","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"c5c6025bfb65ac9a2d556c03f69805c9441676a15e41420dbaabe683b4d0cd73"}

We are flowing, reacting naturally, and I feel present. Sometimes she shifts into a context I do not fully have, like maybe a competition TV show she's keenly interested in. Or a place she wants to go that has cultural weight I do not recognize.\n\nThat is usually when she pulls out Instagram to show her day. Or a blog link to explain a destination. Sometimes both. It helps, but I am aware of the moment stretching. I feel the pressure that this detail matters, that I should understand it now.\n\nThat is to say, the more critical the topic feels to her, the more persuasive and detailed she becomes. Similarly, I would try to mirror words back to her, ask and clarify, and land on a 「そうです。」 moment. Other times, when I'm at home fuming at the missed moments, I wonder whether I should not have just whip out google translate. \n\nPeople I've heard from have argued on both sides whether I should just 相槌 myself out of all situations where you don't understand something, since sometimes me understanding the conversation (even just a little bit) might have been crucial to the speaker. \n\nSometimes during conversations, she lands on a quietまあ、いいか. Meaning, choosing not to engage, not explaining further and moving on. That's when my brain spins into FOMO. Did I miss something important. Did I slow things down. Am I tiring her out.\n\nLogically, I know this gets easier with time. Context gaps close. Discomfort fades, or we make room for it. But emotionally, I worry I am depleting a scarce resource, her patience and energy.\n\nSo I am asking two things.\n\nFirst, are there small, practical tricks people actually use to smooth these moments out. Ways to ask for clarification without stopping the conversation cold. Phrases, habits, or even non verbal cues that help you catch up quietly and stay connected.\n\nSecond, is the better work internal instead. Accepting that language growth is uneven. Letting go of the need to understand everything immediately. Being present, even when a reference slips past, and trusting that it will all make sense later.\n\nIf you have been on either side of this, learner or native speaker, I would love to hear what actually helped. Especially the sneaky, humane strategies that keep conversations warm instead of technical.","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"8a79151fdb064f0775cf49e93396aa416b663923d888a27d9b1d5ff4cffe5cc5"}

We’re three women in our mid 20s that are into anime, geeky stuff, and Japanese fashion.\n\nThe trip was pretty underplanned. i had looked into a lot of stuff when we first decided to go months ago, but by the time our trip was set i was extremely busy with school and other nonsense, so I ended up going much less prepared than i wanted to be. despite this, I think it turned out pretty incredible. I had some big ideas of what i wanted to do during the trip (idol concert, getting my nails done, kimono rental) and some neighborhoods we wanted to go to. I was able to schedule and plan out the bigger ideas a few days ahead of time, and then we planned what neighborhood we’d be in and what stores we’d go to around these things, usually the day before. When we got back to the AirBNB, I would scroll reddit and make a big list of stuff that we could do in the neighborhood we were planning on and then we usually ended up getting to 30-60% of it. \nWe spent a LOT of time clothes shopping. My friends wanted to get full lolita outfits, and I wanted more clothes in general. I really loved the Marui Annex in Shinjuku for clothing (as well as an incredible art store that had tons of prints, keychains, etc from different artists) and Laforet in Harajuku for the same thing but with a bigger selection. Sadly I also really wanted shoes but size 9 womens is too big to fit into almost anything we saw and i didn’t end up getting any I could wear, but up to size 8 should be fine. \nI got a sketchbook on the first day of the trip. This was the best purchase of the entire trip. I'm out of practice drawing, but I still had experience doing live people sketching in cafes and on public transit, and I figured i’d be spending a lot of time on public transit on the trip. Drawing in my sketchbook was so much fun and also lead to some great interactions with locals, i am so happy about it. (if you're interested in seeing some of my drawings i posted a few of them here!)\nAside from wanting to go shopping, I also wanted to see live performances. we went to Harumiya Gardens on our first full day for the nighttime illumination and moon viewing festival and happened to catch a small Sato Kagura performance, which was incredibly cool. we also got cute little rabbit lanterns on a stick we could carry around through the gardens, and on a whim decided to walk from the gardens to tokyo tower, which was a 40 minute walk. Maybe that was a rough first day for my feet but it was just a really fun and low key night and the pilgrimage to tokyo tower was so much fun.\nI also ended up going to a small jazz night that I saw being advertised at a cafe we ate at in the morning. It was super low-key, the space only had room for like 20 people, and they were all older Japanese ladies, I was the only tourist there. It was super fun and I was sketching during the performance and the women in the audience were super into it and pushed me to show it to the band etc, it was just a great evening and fun music!\nThere were also people at restaurants and on the train who liked my sketchbook and one lady even took a photo of my drawing I did of her and her daughter. The sketchbook was really the MVP of the trip!!\nI wanted to go see a small Idol performance and I used the advice in this comment to find a venue that worked, we got to see two groups perform, Congratulations and Meteor Shower Curtain. It was so weird and funny being the only women in the audience but the girls were so cute and interacted with us a bit and I was like, I get it, I get why you'd come to these to get the girls to smile and wave at you.\nWe went to Ikebukuro/Sunshine City on a day that there was a convention going on, so even though I wasn't going to the convention there was open areas where lots of cosplayers were walking around. Super busy, but amazing to see the cosplays and I got photos with a few characters I liked!\nWe also went to karaoke in Akihabara at Karaoke Pasela Akihabara Showa-dori, we were just planning on going to a big chain one we saw on the way to the station but I found a review for one that had apparently legendary ice cream honey toast (it was really good) as well as themed rooms like an Neon Genesis Evangelion themed room. we didn’t get the NGE themed room but it was still really cute and great vibes\nWe got INCREDIBLE sukiyaki at しゃぶ晃, near where we were staying around Mozennakacho station, we stayed there for like 3 hours until we ran out of broth and water and it caramelized on the pan. The man running the place was very cool and spoke a lot of english, he answered a question we were asking between ourselves about what one of the ingredients in our bowl was (a rice cake) that I didn’t even realize he had heard. It came with a sweet blueberry jelly dessert and was just perfect, one of the best dinners of the whole trip.\nWe were originally going to do kimono rental in a Kyoto day trip, but i decided to do it in Hakone instead. It was hard to get up in the morning and get from Tokyo to Hakone in time since the train going up the mountain was so packed (and we were hungover lol, maybe our bad) but once we did the kimono rental it was so fun and magical. We only wanted to do it for a few hours for photographs and stay nearby so we could take it off easily, because I knew the shoes would be painful. Instead of trying to go to shrines for photographs we just went to the nearby Gora park and looked around the greenhouses, which was really nice because we could spend exactly as much time as we wanted there, as well as sit down in lots of places in the gardens and eat at the nice cafe there. We were also the only people wearing kimono there and we got complimented a lot, while lots of people are wearing kimono in Kyoto since theres so many rental places and so many tourists. \nThere was also an extremely funny interaction when i was getting my kimono getup taken off, since I have frizzy brown hair. The single woman who was running the rental place was struggling with my hair getting tangled around the hair ties and she had to call in an assistant to help it get taken out and it took like 20 minutes. My friends used google translate’s voice function to tell what she was saying, and told me later she was saying “It just keeps turning into a fuzz ball. you know they make products for this right?” and when the assistant said my hair was pretty like Aurora from Sleeping Beauty she said “I thought aurora was blonde though..” which was incredibly funny to find out afterwards.\nHakone Kyuan was just incredible, a great Ryokan to stay at for one night. the 7 course dinner was incredible, i ate the wasabi on it’s own despite hating spicy food because it was just that good. We rented out the private onsen and the website said it was 40 minute timeslots but no one told us that in person, I think we were the only one renting it for the night so we were able to stay for like twice the time and lay half in/half out of the bath, spray ourselves with cold shower water while being in the hot bath. All the rooms are so lovely and came with their own hot spring/bathtubs too, and we woke up early to watch the sunrise from our bath. I also got a great drawing of the mountains from our room and my friend looking out the window, and then we found a stamp set at Gora station that I stamped into the corner of the drawing, it’s one of the favorite pages I got in my sketchbook.\nWhen we were in Osaka we ate at a great sushi place that also had grilled fish and a small Omakase experience, something I wanted to do but I was worried I was too picky and would offend the chef, but they offered just five pieces of nigiri as a course and I was able to eat all of it! The vibes there were great and it had great fruit wine. There was a really funny moment where my friend was slightly drunk and I was playfully annoying her, so she gave me a thumbs down, but the chef behind the counter pretended he thought it was about him and said \"oh I'm sorry the food wasn't good\" and then she desperately tried to tell him she loved all of it and everyone laughed with how frantically she was trying to correct herself.\nI also went to a nail artist and got my nails done! She did a great job and was fun to talk to and work with her for my design. She also at one point asked me about American Cartoons, specifically asking me if Rick and Morty was a children's show and telling me she loved the show, and then put on Rick and Morty on an IPad for us to watch together which was hysterical to me.\n\nOverall it was just a great trip, there was even more great moments and stuff that we got to do but I don't want to overload the post any more. I'm definitely already considering going back for a more art-focused trip, we did a lot of shopping which was great but I'd be interested to focus on going to museums and shrines and drawing more outdoor environments and architecture. Here's some small advice from my trip:\nI got a huge bag at the Wiggle Wiggle store and it was super useful for the trip, if you're planning on doing a lot of shopping getting a big bag that you can consolidate shopping bags into by the end of the day is very helpful.\nDon't get an AirBNB, I figure if you're here you already know this but my friends wanted to so I went along with them, but it was a longer walk to the station and worse accommodations and only one room key made it harder to split up when we wanted to.\nIf you're planning on doing scrapbooking and saving paper goods/flyers/tags/etc from the trip, make sure to have a dedicated area to put all your stuff like a folder, it was definitely very hectic and chaotic to pack and find all the stuff I wanted to keep from the trip.","createdAt":"2026-01-03T06:37:05.096Z","rowHash":"9586fb115ab77e7cad3b4819600e8a4f62d1296a5d90ad0a294ff8828f5205a0"}

Looking to make sure my itinerary I’ve drafted makes sense in terms of pacing, order, etc. It’s my first time traveling to Japan but not internationally, and I’m looking to focus mostly on J-fashion, art museums, a few nicer restaurants, as well as enjoying a few days in the countryside during the middle(ish) of my trip! All of my hotel dates are already booked so I’m just looking to fill in activities. TYIA for reading my very long post!!\n\nA few questions:\nI already know my itinerary is too full, which things should I get rid of?\nAre there any museums I shouldn’t miss that I haven’t already added? \nShould I change my Harajuku / Shibuya plans to 3 days if I’m focusing a lot on clothes shopping?\nI’ve read a lot about Akihabara being almost skippable, is Akihabara and Ikebukuro in the same day doable?\nAre there any spots I should stop at along the coast of Wakayama while I have a car for 2 days? \nIs there anything I should know about driving in Japan? I’m traveling from the U.S. so I’m feeling a little hesitant to drive “backwards”. \n\nTokyo\nWed.
