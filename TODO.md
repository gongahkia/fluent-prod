# TODO

## Backend & Infrastructure
1. [ ] Have the backend be hosted on an actual service
2. [ ] Have the frontend call the actual backend service instead of localhost
3. [ ] Have the backend implement the following workflow:
   - [ ] Scrape posts
   - [ ] Sort posts by difficulty of post as a whole first (5 levels, e.g. beginner/advanced)
   - [ ] Identify Verb/Noun/Adjectives
   - [ ] Then show them the posts with partial translation
   - [ ] Each post should have fixed partial translation for all users

## Onboarding Process
4. [ ] Change the onboarding process to be like below:
   - [ ] Show different social media post
   - [ ] Drop down page that shows 5 various posts in varying levels of difficulty (do this first)
   - [ ] Swiping instead of drop down button (if astin wants, we can do A/B testing)

## Features
5. [ ] See whether I can implement a Twitter ghost account for Twitter post rendering

## Mobile Port
- [ ] Port frontend to React Native + Expo
