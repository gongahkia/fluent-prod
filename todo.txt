Error Boundaries: Add React error boundaries for user-facing error handling (React docs).
Source Maps: Ensure Vite and Node.js generate source maps for easier debugging in production.
Cache Efficiency: Backend uses node-cache and tracks cache metrics. Consider:
Periodically persisting cache to disk to avoid cold starts.
Monitoring cache hit/miss rates and tuning TTLs.
Batch Processing: Use startBatchTimer and timeAsync for all async/batch operations. Ensure all heavy backend tasks (e.g., translation, Reddit fetch) are wrapped for timing and logging.
Parallelism: Where possible, use Promise.all or worker threads for parallelizable backend tasks (e.g., translation, vocabulary detection).
NDJSON Handling: For large files, consider streaming reads/writes instead of loading all into memory (seed-showcase-posts.js).
Use React.memo and lazy loading for large components (e.g., NewsFeed, Dictionary).
Debounce API calls and user input where appropriate.
Monitor bundle size with Vite’s analyzer plugin.
Profile and optimize slow endpoints (use timeAsync and log durations).
Use connection pooling for any external APIs or databases.
Consider using a persistent cache (e.g., Redis) if scale increases.
Add health check endpoints for backend services.
Expose performance metrics (e.g., cache stats, request timings) via an admin API or dashboard.
Testing: Add unit/integration tests for backend scripts and services.
Type Safety: Consider TypeScript for both frontend and backend for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.

add a knowledge graph view under the saved words for how words conceputally relate to each other
add support for rendering markdown tables, markdown splits "---" like some posts

feed the below prompt to copilot and demand a fix
"""
addiitonally, is the japanese tokenisation/NER still occuring? to identify groups of japanese characters that should be translated together?

think this through with me, would it make sense for japanese words that are meant to be read together to then be highlighted as one yellow block and when that blcok is clicked, all those words are translated together. for more sane translation instead of the current bit-by-bit approach
"""

prune the entire repository to remove files unnecessary for my new workflow given im using only firebase and vercel now
add the ability to scrape reddit comments for the cache file workflow, to have that written to the cache file (update schema as necessary) and allow it to render in the comments of each post as well
debug the weird translation bug where sometimes the translated word is provided without parsing/properly rendering. have it render properly without "\" or weird translation glitches
fix the pronounciation/audio feature
add code in the frontend that calls real reddit posts from those subreddits first, and if can't then it fallsback on the aforementioned cache
